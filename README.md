# Movie-cataloging-service


Excited to share about my follow up to the Netflix clone with my new project ,

Letterbox which is a movie cataloguing web  application similar to the site Letterboxd. 



The project utilizes the node.js framework to manage interactions with the  database written in MYSQL, with Express.js acting as the connection between the backend and the frontend . On the frontend, React.js is utilized to display data fetched from the database. The setup used ensures smooth communication between the frontend and backend components of the project.



# Front Page:



The front page includes a list of upcoming movies to be released, alongside movies that are currently trending among users. Additionally, the front

page has a search tab which users can use for looking up movies by entering the movie’s title.



# Networking Capabilities:



The platform allows users to connect with one another by allowing them to follow one another. Users have the option to search for specific individuals through the search bar in the socials page, which also allows users to view who they follow and are followed by.



# User Profile :



The users profile displays the list of movies they’ve logged in to the platform

and movies they have saved from watch later . The user can also view the logged and watchlater movies of the people they follow . 



# Movie Page:

Information about the movie, such as the name, release date, description, user ratings and a set of user reviews. Additionally screenshots from the movie are also included. Users have the option to log the movie into their list of watched movies, and rate and review said movie.



# Password Reset screen:



Users of the platform have an option to change their username and password, in addition to to having the choice to delete their account if they so desire.





It also lets user add their own movies to the local database by searching up the movie in the IMDB database and adding it . ****
